Glad to share that I created a website called GitHub User Search where user can see their repositories and profile details as well as search for other GitHub user to see their profile details, repositories & many more. Site is fully responsive for all screen with light and dark mode option.

<br/>


### Landing Page: 
Here user will get the option for login with his GitHub username with search functionality for username.

![Mobile Responsiveness](https://miro.medium.com/max/331/1*aWdaQcTfj3_CNVxQk8y0dA.png)

### Home Page:
 Initially after login user can see their repositories, followers profile and self profile with all profile data. After search for any GitHub user, user can see their repositories and profile data as well.
